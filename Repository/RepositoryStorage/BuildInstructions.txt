Build Instructions
==================
To build and run this demo you need to:
- make sure the properties on the CodeToTest, TestDriver, and TestInterfaces projects are making
  libraries, not console applications, e.g., right-click on project in Solution Explorer, select 
  properties > Applications > Output Type and set to class library
- TestDriver needs a reference for CodeToTest, e.g., right-click on References in the TestDriver projects,
  then check the corresponding CodeToTest project
- Both TestDrivers and TestHarness need a reference to TestInterfaces
- build the solution by right clicking on solution tab and selecting build
- copy the dlls from the bin/debug directories in each of the project's code folders
  for CodeToTest and TestDriver into LoadingTests/Tests folder
- now you can run
- every time you change the code in CodeToTest or TestDriver you need to copy the
  new dlls into the Tests folder
