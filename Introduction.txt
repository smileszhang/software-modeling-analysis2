In project3, I use a lot of package to describe the function of communication between client, testharness and repository. The communication between these three part is WCF. In project3, I did not separate the channel between files and messages. This can be a huge problem that files cannot be transferred in time when needed. When I implement specific function and use these code provided by professor, I realize that uploading files and downloading files are totally different channel between transmitting message.

Meanwhile, when I code this program, I start to understand message¡¯s transmission. In project3, I am not very clear about this. We need to package information we want to transmit into a specific format that can be transmitted to another service. TestRequest and Testresult needs to be transmitted in such format. So there will be some method to extract information from it. By coding I learn some knowledge of it.

In addition, create channel and open service make me feel challenging in this program. Because the most bugs are ¡°there is no listener there¡±. Because I have never had a contact with this aspect so I feel challenging and needs to study more knowledge.

Also, the design of WPF needs me to be very careful. And there are many convenient syntax for users to design. Due my unfamiliar using, I use a lot of time to study how to control these textbox or listbox.

In this project, TestExecutive is the startup program. Client will be shown as a WPF window, TestExecutive and repository will be shown as command-line window. TestExecutive will record activities in test harness. Repository will save test request, test result, dll files.TestExecutive will download dll files from repository automatically according to the test information. There will be a temporal directory in testexecutive directory and then be deleted when test finishes. Also, client can query files by inputting key words. And clients can read files by click one searching result.
